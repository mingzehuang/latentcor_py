Introduction
------------

No Python software package is currently available that allows accurate and fast correlation estimation from mixed variable data in a unifying manner. The Python package :code:`latentcor`, introduced here, thus represents the first stand-alone R package for computation of latent correlation that takes into account all variable types (continuous/binary/ordinal/zero-inflated), comes with an optimized memory footprint, and is computationally efficient, essentially making latent correlation estimation almost as fast as rank-based correlation estimation.
Python package :code:`latentcor` utilizes the powerful semi-parametric latent Gaussian copula models to estimate latent correlations between mixed data types :cite:p:`fan2017high,quan2018rank,yoon2020sparse,yoon2021fast`. The package allows to estimate correlations between any of continuous/binary/ternary/zero-inflated (truncated) variable types. The underlying implementation takes advantage of fast multi-linear interpolation scheme with a clever choice of grid points that give the package a small memory footprint, and allows to use the latent correlations with sub-sampling and bootstrapping.
